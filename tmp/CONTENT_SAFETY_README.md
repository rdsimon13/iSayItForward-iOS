# Content Safety & Reporting System

This implementation provides a comprehensive content safety and reporting system for the iSayItForward iOS app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Content Reporting
- **Report Button**: Added to SIFDetailView for reporting inappropriate content
- **Report Form**: Comprehensive form with reason selection and optional description
- **Report Types**: 8 different report categories (harassment, spam, hate speech, etc.)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Users cannot report the same content twice
- **Self-Report Prevention**: Users cannot report their own content

### 2. User Blocking System
- **Block Users**: Users can block other users to prevent interactions
- **Block Reasons**: Optional reasons for blocking (harassment, spam, personal choice, etc.)
- **Blocked Users Management**: View and manage blocked users in ProfileView
- **Content Filtering**: Automatically filters content from blocked users
- **Interaction Prevention**: Prevents interactions between blocked users

### 3. Content Moderation
- **Moderation Queue**: Admin interface for reviewing reported content
- **Moderation Actions**: Multiple action types (no action, remove content, warn user, suspend, ban)
- **Report Tracking**: Full lifecycle tracking from pending to resolved
- **Moderator Notes**: Ability to add notes during moderation process
- **Content Preview**: Preview reported content during moderation

## File Structure

### Data Models
- `ReportItem.swift` - Content report data model and enums
- `BlockedUser.swift` - User blocking data model and logic

### Services
- `ContentSafetyService.swift` - Handles reporting and moderation operations
- `BlockingService.swift` - Manages user blocking functionality

### Views
- `ReportContentView.swift` - Content reporting interface
- `BlockedUsersView.swift` - Blocked users management
- `UserActionSheet.swift` - User blocking interface
- `ModerationQueueView.swift` - Moderation admin interface

### Updated Views
- `SIFDetailView.swift` - Added report and user action buttons
- `ProfileView.swift` - Added blocked users management link
- `MySIFsView.swift` - Added content filtering for blocked users

## Database Collections

### Firebase Firestore Collections
- `reports` - Content reports with full moderation lifecycle
- `blocked_users` - User blocking relationships
- `sifs` - Enhanced with moderation fields (`isRemoved`, `removedDate`, `removedBy`)

## Security Features

### Authentication Checks
- All operations require authenticated users
- User identity verification for all safety actions
- Prevention of self-targeting actions

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Duplicate action prevention

### Privacy Protection
- Users can control their blocking preferences
- Content filtering respects user choices
- Secure handling of sensitive moderation data

## Usage Examples

### Reporting Content
1. View any SIF content in SIFDetailView
2. Tap the menu button (ellipsis) in the top right
3. Select "Report Content"
4. Choose a reason and add optional description
5. Submit the report

### Blocking Users
1. View any SIF content in SIFDetailView

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Duplicate actions
- Missing data
- Permission errors

All errors are presented to users with clear, actionable messages.

## Testing

The implementation includes validation tests for:
- Data model integrity
- Business logic correctness
- Content filtering functionality
- Error handling robustness

Run tests with: `swift tmp/test_content_safety.swift`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Push notifications for moderation updates
- Machine learning content classification
- Bulk moderation actions
- Advanced reporting analytics
- Integration with external content moderation services
- User appeal system for moderation decisions
