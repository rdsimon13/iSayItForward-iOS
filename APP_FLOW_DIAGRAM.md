## Before vs After

### Before (White Screen Issue):
```
📱 App Launch → ⚪ White Screen (Firebase not ready)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
📱 App Launch → 🚀 Loading Screen → 👋 Welcome Screen → 🏡 Home Screen
```

## Key Improvements:

1. **Proper Initialization**: App now waits for Firebase to be ready
2. **User Feedback**: Loading states inform users what's happening
3. **Error Recovery**: Failed initialization can be retried
4. **Accessibility**: Screen readers and assistive technologies supported
5. **iOS Compatibility**: Works on both iOS 15 and 16+
6. **Debug Support**: Hidden debug menu for troubleshooting

## User Experience Flow:

1. **App Starts**: User sees animated logo with "Loading..." message
2. **Firebase Check**: App verifies Firebase configuration
3. **Welcome Screen**: User sees login form with validation
4. **Form Interaction**: Real-time validation with haptic feedback
5. **Authentication**: Loading indicator during sign-in process
6. **Home Screen**: Appropriate version based on iOS version
7. **Debug Access**: 5-tap gesture reveals debug information

This implementation ensures users never see a white screen and always understand what the app is doing.
